Overview
========

Requirements
------------
The Python extension has the following system requirements:

- `PHP`_ version 5.2.0 or later
- `PEAR`_ installer version 1.4.3 or later

.. _PHP: http://www.php.net/
.. _PEAR: http://pear.php.net/

Installation
------------
The easiest way to install the Perforce extension is by using the PECL
installer::

    pecl install python

If you're building from source code, should use the ``--with-python``
configuration option.  If your copy of the Python hasn't been installed in one
of the default locations, you can specify it as a parameter::

    --with-python=/opt/python

More detailed information on installing PECL packages in general can be found
in the `Installation of PECL Extensions`_ section of the `PHP Manual`_.

.. _Installation of PECL Extensions: http://www.php.net/manual/install.pecl.php
.. _PHP Manual: http://www.php.net/manual/

Source Code
-----------
This package's source code is hosted the `PHP CVS repository`_.  To check out
a read-only (anonymous) copy of the source code, start by logging in to the
PHP CVS server.  The password for the ``cvsread`` account is ``phpfi``.

::

    cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login

Then you'll be able to check out the Python's extension's source code::

    cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co -d python pecl/python

A number of unit tests are included to help maintain correct and expected
behavior.  The tests can be run using PECL tool's ``run-tests`` command::

    pecl run-tests -p python

Additional unit test contributions are welcome, especially when they increase
code coverage or exercise specific use cases.

Usage
=====

INI Settings
------------

python.optimize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``python.optimize`` INI setting controls the Python interpreter's runtime
optimization level.  This is a global, system-wide setting and therefore can
only be set in the PHP.ini file.

When set to **0** (the default), no additional optimizations are enabled, and
the built-in ``__debug__`` flag is True.

When set to **1** (equivalent to Python's ``-O`` command line option), the
Python interpreter will generate optimized bytecode, and the built-in
``__debug__`` flag is set to False.

When set to **2** (equivalent to Python's ``-OO`` command line option), the
Python doc-strings will be removed in addition to the above optimizations.
